My family has been a loyal Windows user for 14 years (even longer). Behind the OS that has a wide ecosystem like Microsoft Office, I started to hate Windows since its eleventh version. When Windows was released, I really expected that Windows was the future, having a translucent, rounded and clean design.

My family's PC was just updated to Windows 11 last year, at first I was very happy and had almost no problems. But over time, I hated Windows 11 and wished I had never seen the update. There are quite a few problems that I have experienced in Windows 11. Such as very slow responsiveness, inconsistent design. And lately, my PC has been very laggy and often suddenly turns off by itself, even though my family just gave me a new Power Supply. This is roughly what our PC system info looks like: **(Using [Win+R] > `DxDiag`)**

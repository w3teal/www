In this one day, where I started #100DaysToOffload, I am very enthusiastic and have even made 5 posts! Blogging is the most useful way for me to spend time. Moreover, today is one of the days in the holy month of Ramadan: Fasting while waiting for Maghrib! (Don't just hold your thirst, pray too!). So time feels very fast, even in every hour today, you can see the blogs arranged chronologically every hour. What if we change from "100 Days To Offload" to "30 Days To Offload"? If I make 5 posts every day for 30 days, I think there will be 150 posts!

Yes, of course at the beginning, I was very enthusiastic in realizing these 100 posts. But I hope that I have enough time and a good mood so that I can do it well. After all, 1 year is a long time, right? Writing freely is the best therapy I have ever gotten!

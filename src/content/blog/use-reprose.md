Writing posts for Static Site Generator has been a mess lately. Why? There is no consistent CMS, some have to be paid, or make a big config to make the CMS work.

So how do I solve it? I just use Reprose! An open source GitHub CMS, you just need to **Login**, go to the repository and press "**+ Create**". And you have **a WYSIWYG editor**! Almost similar to the editor in DEV.to (I use it a lot).

Not only that, there is also a button to see the preview! This is what it looks like

Once you are done, just hit Save and it will commit the changes. Easy, right? For example, this post is the first one made using Reprose, hopefully this service will run for a long time! ðŸ¥°

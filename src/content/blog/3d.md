  The easiest way to convey realtime things on the web

Lately, I've been really into 3d characters on Sketchfab. And I even made a 3d logo for my W3Teal in Paint 3D! (You can see how this 3d logo works in the navbar, I used [`<model-viewer>`](https://modelviewer.dev/editor/)!)

- If you want the GLB: [/3d/W3.glb](/3d/W3.glb)

I first became obsessed with 3d objects on the web, after seeing [Nicole on SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/nicole-051942e351914e269634bc90eb7516f8). It was so cool and neat! So I decided to add it to my website. Under the name "Teacole"! (It's licensed [CC Atrribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which allow Remixes!)

<model-viewer src="/3d/teacole/nicole.glb" ar ar-modes="webxr scene-viewer quick-look" camera-controls tone-mapping="neutral" poster="/3d/teacole/poster.webp" shadow-intensity="1" style="width: 100%; height: 70vh;">
</model-viewer>

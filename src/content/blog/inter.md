As you can see on this website, it uses the Inter font. It's beautiful and easy to read. I've been a fan of using the Inter font since the website I created in the new year 2025. At first I ignored using the system's default font, but after finding a good font, getting Inter and putting it in, the website instantly became different.

In the past, I liked using Lato and Figtree fonts the most at the beginning of my era as a programmer. Then, I plan to use Figtree on my projects, (on my old websites). And I started to prioritize convenience (Just use the built-in fonts). What I don't like is, it's not consistent for many devices. If I use web safe fonts like Arial or Verdana, it's great. But there are two things I noticed, Arial is too generic, Verdana is too old school.

Inter is the most perfect font I've ever encountered since I started using it. And I hope this project will not die. Long live Inter! (Thanks Rasmus for hosting and keeping this Inter font idea alive.)

I first discovered the “[100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/)” activity [on Kytta's website](https://www.kytta.dev/blog/enough/). Since I discovered it, I have been very interested in making more posts. This post is not the first post in this activity, but the eighth. (Even though it lacks context, the post doesn't need to be serious, right?)

This is the eighth post this year! ([GMX.css posts](https://dev.to/t/gmxcss) don't count of course). Since I've created a new website, my imagination and typing skills have started to deepen. And that's the reason why I want to enter this contest. (We are not entering this contest to fight each other, but to share information!)

So in the future, I will be increasing my posts. But this may be canceled, I often have a low mood because of my school. Almost all the posts I make here are translated using DeepL through [DXTranslate](https://dxtranslate.vercel.app/) (and sometimes Google Translate), so if the English language is not natural. Apologies, I'm not very good at English and my first language is Indonesian.

There is a lot I can take away from creating these blogs, I can improve my skills, and I no longer expect people to read my posts, so my posts feel personal. This is a good new era!

When I wrote a [blog about my move to GitLab](https://dev.to/w3teal/i-moved-to-gitlab-idl), since then my coding activities began to fade. I know, GitHub could not be run at that time, because [now it can (I don't know why)](https://bsky.app/profile/l.birulangit.web.id/post/3lfrj7cgmic2e), I started using GitHub again. The biggest reason to use it is the ecosystem and popularity. My project on GitLab, almost never seen by people, there is no other place where I can get stars and opinions other than GitHub. I also created an account on Codeberg, it is a good Git provider, only the same as GitLab in terms of popularity.

So I have the end result, I have 3 git accounts, irregular, some are updated on GitHub or GitLab. While Codeberg is in the middle, so I started to avoid GitLab and use GitHub and Codeberg. The UI of both providers is the same, so I don't get confused when moving from place to place.

Currently the proprietary software I use are GitHub, Google (the whole ecosystem! Including YouTube), and Windows. Windows is an OS that is often annoying, including what I often experience now is problematic time synchronization (suddenly going backwards). The reason why I still use Windows is because my family doesn't understand about alternatives like Linux, another main reason is that Microsoft Office is not available on Linux (Although there are alternatives like LibreOffice...) When I have a personal PC, I will try to use Linux as my main OS. I also really enjoy trying Linux OSes on VMware, Linux Mint is the best!

In coding, I never spend anything, Git is hosted on GitHub, deployed using Vercel. Domain using free subdomain and is-a.dev, no other software I ever pay for! Even... Microsoft Office that I use is a (to put it politely, NOT PAID!) version, I use [massgrave](https://massgrave.dev/) to activate it, and it is amazing.
